# Project Badge - Server-Side Rendering with Python

## Description

This project introduces **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)** using **Python** and **Flask**.
Server-side rendering is a powerful technique where web pages are generated on the server and sent to the client as fully formed HTML. This contrasts with client-side rendering, where the browser builds the web page using JavaScript and dynamic data.

Through this project, you will learn how to implement SSR using Flask and leverage the **Jinja templating engine** to create dynamic, efficient, and SEO-friendly web applications.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you will be able to:

- Understand the concepts of server-side rendering and how it differs from client-side rendering.
- Learn the benefits of using server-side rendering in web development.
- Implement SSR in Python using the **Flask** framework.
- Utilize the **Jinja templating engine** to dynamically generate HTML pages.
- Read and display data from various sources including **JSON**, **CSV**, and **SQLite databases**.
- Handle dynamic content and user inputs in web applications.

## What to Expect

You will build a **Flask application** that serves web pages using server-side rendering techniques. The project will guide you from creating basic templates to integrating dynamic content from multiple data sources. By the end, you will have a solid understanding of:

- SSR principles
- Templating with Jinja
- Building efficient, scalable web applications
