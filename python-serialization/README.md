## üêçPython - Serialization

This project is dedicated to the study of **marshaling** and **serialization** ‚Äî fundamental concepts in computer science that facilitate the **storage**, **transmission**, and **reconstruction** of data. It focuses on real-world applications and helps build a solid foundation for data handling across various mediums.

## üéØ Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you will be able to:

* Understand the difference between marshaling and serialization.
* Serialize and deserialize data in formats such as JSON, Pickle, and XML.
* Work with custom objects and persist their state.
* Convert between CSV and JSON.
* Handle errors and data integrity during the serialization process.
* Recognize where serialization is used (e.g., APIs, distributed systems, file persistence).

## üõ† Requirements

* Python version: 3.8.5
* OS: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
* Code style: `pycodestyle` 2.7.\*
* All scripts should be executable and start with `#!/usr/bin/python3`
* A `README.md` is mandatory
* Test cases (where required) reside in the `tests/` directory

## ‚úÖ Tasks

### 0. Basic Serialization

Create a basic serialization module that adds the functionality to serialize a Python dictionary to a JSON file and deserialize the JSON file to recreate the Python Dictionary.

### 1. Pickling Custom Classes

Learn how to serialize and deserialize custom Python objects using the pickle module.

### 2.  Converting CSV Data to JSON Format

The objective of this exercise is to gain experience in reading data from one format (CSV) and converting it into another format (JSON) using serialization techniques.

### 3. Serializing and Deserializing with XML

In this exercise we‚Äôll explore serialization and deserialization using XML as an alternative format to JSON.
