## ⚙️ Requirements

### Python Scripts

- ✅ Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- ✅ All files will be interpreted/compiled on **Ubuntu 20.04 LTS** using **Python 3.8.\***
- ✅ All files must end with a new line
- ✅ The first line of all files must be exactly: `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- ✅ A `README.md` file at the root of the repo is mandatory
- ✅ Your code must follow `pycodestyle` (version 2.7.\*)
- ✅ All files must be executable
- ✅ File length will be tested using `wc`

## 🧠 More Info

### Pycodestyle

Pycodestyle is now the new standard for Python code style. It enforces consistency and readability across Python scripts. While it may seem strict at first, it helps build clean and maintainable codebases.
