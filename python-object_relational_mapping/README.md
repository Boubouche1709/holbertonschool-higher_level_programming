# üêç Python - Object-relational mapping

## Background Context
In this project, you will link two amazing worlds: Databases and Python!

In the first part, you will use the module MySQLdb to connect to a MySQL database and execute your SQL queries.

In the second part, you will use the module SQLAlchemy (don‚Äôt ask me how to pronounce it‚Ä¶) an Object Relational Mapper (ORM).

The biggest difference is: no more SQL queries! Indeed, the purpose of an ORM is to abstract the storage to the usage. With an ORM, your biggest concern will be ‚ÄúWhat can I do with my objects‚Äù and not ‚ÄúHow this object is stored? where? when?‚Äù. You won‚Äôt write any SQL queries only Python code. Last thing, your code won‚Äôt be ‚Äústorage type‚Äù dependent. You will be able to change your storage easily without re-writing your entire project.

## üéØ Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

### General
- How to connect to a MySQL database from a Python script
- How to SELECT rows in a MySQL table from a Python script
- How to INSERT rows in a MySQL table from a Python script
- What ORM means
- How to map a Python Class to a MySQL table

- Your files will be executed with MySQLdb version 2.0.x
- Your files will be executed with SQLAlchemy version 1.4.x
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.7.*)
- All your files must be executable
- The length of your files will be tested using wc
