# 🐍 Python Data Structures: Lists, Tuples

---

## 📢 Author’s Disclaimer

Welcome to the Python world!

You'll soon find that with Python (and the majority of higher level languages), there are ten different ways to do the same thing. Some tasks will expect only one implementation, while other tasks will have multiple possible implementations.

Python has a linter / style guide, called PEP8, also now known as PyCode. At Holberton, we won't start off with using PyCode, because it's much more strict compared to PEP8. Don't worry if you see a warning when you are running PEP8, you can ignore it.

Enjoy!

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts without relying on Google:

- What are lists and how to use them
- What are the differences and similarities between strings and lists
- What are the most common methods of lists and how to use them
- How to use lists as stacks and queues
- What are list comprehensions and how to use them
- What are tuples and how to use them
- When to use tuples versus lists
- What is a sequence
- What is tuple packing
- What is sequence unpacking
- What is the del statement and how to use it

## ⚙️ Requirements

### Python Scripts

- ✅ Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- ✅ All files will be interpreted/compiled on **Ubuntu 20.04 LTS** using **Python 3.8.\***
- ✅ All files must end with a new line
- ✅ The first line of all files must be exactly: `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- ✅ A `README.md` file at the root of the repo is mandatory
- ✅ Your code must follow `pycodestyle` (version 2.7.\*)
- ✅ All files must be executable
- ✅ File length will be tested using `wc`

## 🧠 More Info

### Pycodestyle

Pycodestyle is now the new standard for Python code style. It enforces consistency and readability across Python scripts. While it may seem strict at first, it helps build clean and maintainable codebases.
