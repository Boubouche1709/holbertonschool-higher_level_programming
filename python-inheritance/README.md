# üêç Python Inheritance

## Resources

- [Inheritance](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#inheritance)
- [Multiple inheritance](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#multiple-inheritance)
- [Inheritance in Python](https://www.packtpub.com/en-us/learning/how-to-tutorials/inheritance-python/)
- [Learn to Program 10 : Inheritance Magic Methods](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8kCdLCi6Lk)

## üéØ Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts without relying on Google:

- What is a superclass, baseclass or parentclass
- What is a subclass
- How to list all attributes and methods of a class or instance
- When can an instance have new attributes
- How to inherit class from another
- How to define a class with multiple base classes
- What is the default class every class inherit from
- How to override a method or attribute inherited from the base class
- Which attributes or methods are available by heritage to subclasses
- What is the purpose of inheritance
- What are, when and how to use isinstance, issubclass, type and super built-in functions

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

### Python Scripts

- ‚úÖ Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- ‚úÖ All files will be interpreted/compiled on **Ubuntu 20.04 LTS** using **Python 3.8.\***
- ‚úÖ All files must end with a new line
- ‚úÖ The first line of all files must be exactly: `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- ‚úÖ A `README.md` file at the root of the repo is mandatory
- ‚úÖ Your code must follow `pycodestyle` (version 2.7.\*)
- ‚úÖ All files must be executable
- ‚úÖ File length will be tested using `wc`

### Python Test Cases

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files should end with a new line
- All your test files should be inside a folder tests
- All your test files should be text files (extension: .txt)
- All your tests should be executed by using this command: python3 -m doctest ./tests/*
- All your modules should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
- All your classes should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)')
- All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)')
- A documentation is not a simple word, it‚Äôs a real sentence explaining what‚Äôs the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)
- We strongly encourage you to work together on test cases, so that you don‚Äôt miss any edge case

### Documentation

- Do not use the words import or from inside your comments, the checker will think you are trying to import some modules
