# 🚀 JavaScript Basics – Scripting and Fundamentals

## 🧠 Background Context

JavaScript is a powerful and versatile language used for many purposes.
In this project, we focus on two main aspects:

1. **Scripting** – similar to what we did with Python
2. **Web Front-End** – which will later be used to make our AirBnB project dynamic using **JavaScript** and **jQuery**.

For now, the goal is to understand the **core concepts** of JavaScript by writing simple scripts and learning its syntax and logic.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain (without Google):

### General
- Why **JavaScript programming** is amazing
- How to **run a JavaScript script**
- How to **create variables and constants**
- Differences between **var**, **const**, and **let**
- All **available data types** in JavaScript
- How to use **if** and **if...else** statements
- How to **write comments**
- How to **assign values to variables**
- How to use **while** and **for** loops
- How to use **break** and **continue**
- What a **function** is and how to use one
- What happens when a function **doesn’t return anything**
- **Variable scope** (local vs global)
- What are the **arithmetic operators** and how to use them
- How to **manipulate dictionaries (objects)**
- How to **import modules** or external files

---

## 🧩 Requirements

### General
- **Allowed editors:** vi, vim, emacs
- All files will be interpreted on **Ubuntu 20.04 LTS** using **Node.js (version 14.x)**
- All files must end with a **new line**
- The **first line** of every file must be exactly:
  ```bash
  #!/usr/bin/node
  ```
- A **README.md** file is **mandatory** at the root of the project
- Code must be **semistandard compliant** (version 16.x.x)
  - Rules: Standard + semicolons on top
  - Style reference: **AirBnB style guide**
- All files must be **executable**
- File length will be tested using the `wc` command

## ⚙️ Setup & Installation

### Install Node.js 14
```bash
$ curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | sudo -E bash -
$ sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
```

### Install semistandard
```bash
$ sudo npm install semistandard --global
```

For more information, refer to the [semistandard documentation](https://github.com/standard/semistandard).


## 🧾 Best Practices

- Always start files with `#!/usr/bin/node`
- Use **const** for variables that never change
- Use **let** for variables that change over time
- Avoid using **var**
- Follow **semistandard** style rules
- Add **comments** to explain logic and improve readability
