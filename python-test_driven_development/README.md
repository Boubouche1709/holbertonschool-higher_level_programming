# üêç Python Hello World

## Background Context

### Important notice on intranet checks for Python projects

#### Starting from today:

- Based on the requirements of each task, you should always write the documentation (module(s) + function(s)) and tests first, before you actually code anything
- The intranet checks for Python projects won‚Äôt be released before their first deadline, in order for you to focus more on TDD and think about all possible cases
- We strongly encourage you to work together on test cases, so that you don‚Äôt miss any edge case. But not in the implementation of them!
- Don‚Äôt trust the user, always think about all possible edge cases

## Resources

- [doctest ‚Äî Test interactive Python examples](https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/doctest.html)
- [doctest ‚Äì Testing through documentation](https://pymotw.com/3/doctest/)
- [Unit Tests in Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lfv5tUGsn8)

## üéØ Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts without relying on Google:

- Why Python programming is awesome
- What‚Äôs an interactive test
- Why tests are important
- How to write Docstrings to create tests
- How to write documentation for each module and function
- What are the basic option flags to create tests
- How to find edge cases

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

### Python Scripts

- ‚úÖ Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- ‚úÖ All files will be interpreted/compiled on **Ubuntu 20.04 LTS** using **Python 3.8.\***
- ‚úÖ All files must end with a new line
- ‚úÖ The first line of all files must be exactly: `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- ‚úÖ A `README.md` file at the root of the repo is mandatory
- ‚úÖ Your code must follow `pycodestyle` (version 2.7.\*)
- ‚úÖ All files must be executable
- ‚úÖ File length will be tested using `wc`

### Python Test Cases

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files should end with a new line
- All your test files should be inside a folder tests
- All your test files should be text files (extension: .txt)
- All your tests should be executed by using this command: python3 -m doctest ./tests/*
- All your modules should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
- All your functions should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)')
- A documentation is not a simple word, it‚Äôs a real sentence explaining what‚Äôs the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)
- We strongly encourage you to work together on test cases, so that you don‚Äôt miss any edge case ‚Äì The Checker is checking for tests!
